# Screenbot

Discord bot that sends a screenshot of any website that is linked to.

## Running

1. Make sure you're running a version of Node.js between v16.13 and v17. I recommend [n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n) for this. Simply install it and run `n engine`.
2. Make sure you have Yarn 1.22 or newer installed (`npm install -g yarn`).
3. Run `yarn` to ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. Put `DISCORD_TOKEN=<your token here>` in a new file called `.env`.
4. Run `yarn dev`.
